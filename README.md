# CredHub
## Overview
* CredHub is an Android application designed to securely store and manage important personal documents, including IDs and diplomas. It leverages blockchain technology for secure credential storage and smart contracts to enhance security. The app aims to offer a robust solution for document verification, ensuring that users' credentials are easily accessible and highly secure.
* With the use of mock data to replicate both WYDOT and University of Wyoming databases, we created and implemented API to replicate the actual process and connection.
